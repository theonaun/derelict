5. Have other user place the keys you shared with them in their /home/user/.brickton folder.
    # Note that 2 numeric ultralong keys (NUKs) are required for interactive chat/transfer.

OSX terminal command to show hidden files: defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles YES; killall -HUP Finder
/dev/random is blocking (very slow)
